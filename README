ELinks - Full-Featured Text WWW Browse

This is a fork of elinks, the text mode web browser.

It was cloned from their git repo by me on 31st Dec 2013. Their website is still
up but it appears that their git no longer works, and none of the support/bug report
links seem to work.

This is patched to fix the following issues:

• Bug where elinks wouldn't follow gopher html links.
• Bug in gopher type 7 index queries.
• Bug in gopher remote directory links.

Below is a list of all the support gopher entities that elinks supports:
(Taken from gopher.c)

    GOPHER_UNKNOWN      =  0 , /* Special fall-back entity */
    GOPHER_FILE         = '0',
    GOPHER_DIRECTORY    = '1',
    GOPHER_CSO          = '2',
    GOPHER_ERROR        = '3',
    GOPHER_MACBINHEX    = '4',
    GOPHER_PCBINARY     = '5',
    GOPHER_UUENCODED    = '6',
    GOPHER_INDEX        = '7',
    GOPHER_TELNET       = '8',
    GOPHER_BINARY       = '9',
    GOPHER_GIF          = 'g',
    GOPHER_HTML         = 'h', /* HTML */
    GOPHER_CHTML        = 'H', /* HTML */
    GOPHER_MIME         = 'm',
    GOPHER_SOUND        = 's',
    GOPHER_WWW          = 'w', /* W3 address */
    GOPHER_IMAGE        = 'I',
    GOPHER_TN3270       = 'T',
    GOPHER_INFO         = 'i', /* Information or separator line */
    GOPHER_DUPLICATE    = '+',
    GOPHER_PLUS_IMAGE   = ':', /* Addition from Gopher Plus */
    GOPHER_PLUS_MOVIE   = ';',
    GOPHER_PLUS_SOUND   = '<',
    GOPHER_PLUS_PDF     = 'P',

There are a huge number of configure options. Do ./configure --help to see a
full list. As far as I can tell they all work apart from --enable-debug.

List of optional features:

  --with-guile
  --enable-cgi
  --enable-finger
  --enable-fsp
  --enable-gopher
  --enable-nntp
  --enable-smb
  --enable-88-colors
  --enable-256-colors
  --enable-true-color
  --enable-exmode
  --enable-html-highlight
  --enable-bittorrent
  --enable-fastmem
  --disable-mouse

Historical notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initially, ELinks was a development version of Links (Lynx-like text WWW
browser), with more liberal features policy and development style.  Its purpose
was to provide an alternative to Links, and to test and tune various new
features, but still provide good rock-solid releases inside stable branches.

Why not contribute to Links instead?  Well, first I made a bunch of patches for
the original Links, but Mikulas wasn't around to integrate them, so I started
releasing my fork. When he came back, a significant number of them got refused
because Mikulas did not like them as he just wouldn't have any use for them
himself.  He aims to keep Links at a relatively closed feature set and merge
only new features which he himself needs.  It has the advantage that the tree is
very narrow and the code is small and contains very little bloat.

ELinks, on the contrary, aims to provide a full-featured web browser, superior
to both lynx and w3m and with the power (but not slowness and memory usage) of
Mozilla, Konqueror and similar browsers. However, to prevent drastic bloating
of the code, the development is driven in the course of modularization and
separation of add-on modules (like cookies, bookmarks, ssl, scripting etc).
