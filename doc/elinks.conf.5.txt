:Description:	ELinks configuration file

NAME
----
elinks.conf - ELinks configuration file

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
set        <option> = <value>
set_domain <domain> <option> = <value>
unset      <option>
bind       "<keymap>" "<key>" = "<action>"
include    "<file>"

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The `elinks.conf` file contains configuration information for ELinks.  It can
be used to configure the behaviour of ELinks in a wide variety of ways:
protocol behaviour, keybindings, colors used for rendering and for the user
interface.

It is read at startup and saved only when requested. All options described in
this document can be configured from within ELinks. Editing of elinks.conf is
needed only if you want to override the values of some options in individual
domains (`set_domain`).

// elinks-web/website.conf links "the MIME chapter of the ELinks manual" below

Note that MIME-related options used for specifying handlers of various
MIME types are not fully described in this document. Documentation for
these options can be found in the MIME chapter of the ELinks manual.
Keybindings can also be specified in elinks.conf.  This is described
in man:elinkskeys[5].

SYNTAX
------

The syntax of the configuration file is very simple. The elinks.conf file is a
free-form ASCII text file. The file may contain extra tabs and newlines for
formatting purposes. Keywords in the file are case-sensitive. Comments may be
placed anywhere within the file (except within quotes). Comments begin with
the # character and end at the end of the line.

EXAMPLES
--------

Some sample settings:

	# Use asynchronous DNS resolver?
	set connection.async_dns = 1
	# horizontal text margin.
	set document.browse.margin_width = 3
	# Default document codepage.
	set document.codepage.assume = "ISO-8859-1"
	# User defined protocol handlers
	set protocol.user.mailto.unix = "mutt %h -s \"%s\""
